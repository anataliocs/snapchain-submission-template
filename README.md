### Prompt
> For this hackathon, we invite you to prove web3 UX doesn’t have to suck by building a web3 dapp with the seamlessness, intuition, and fluidity of web2 UX. Prove it can be done! Identify ways to create a seamless and intuitive user experience, including:
> 
> A smooth, friction-free onboarding process that gets the user going in seconds;
> Passkeys (e.g. Face ID, fingerprint scanners, etc. built into devices) for user authentication and transaction signing, skipping the wallet integration (where it makes sense);
> A smart wallet integration to simplify and automate DeFi workflows, with the benefit of reducing the need for user interaction, and thereby improving the user experience.
